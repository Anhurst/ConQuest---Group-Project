Target Demographic:
High school children between the ages of 14 and 18, who experience social anxiety or who have social anxiety disorders. We want to focus on those who have trouble interacting with their peers and others around them and those who experience physical distress during social encounters but still want to be able to interact with others.

Project Description:
We will be designing an app that helps kids with social anxiety disorder. Our app will attempt to engage youths through interaction and practice by posing as a game. The phone app will present the user with quests to complete and also display information about the user’s progress in the game, such as level progress, achievements, etc. The watch on the other hand, will prompt the user record the users heart rate as they complete quests such as asking for directions when they’re in a city, or asking someone’s name while at school. It will also give the user tips and reminders about the quest they are currently completing. This application will help them learn about their condition and practice engaging socially in a fun way.
